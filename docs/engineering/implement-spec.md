## What it does

`implement-spec` takes a [spec](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/spec) and its [tickets](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/ticket) and lands the whole thing in one run. The orchestrating [agent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/agent) hands each ticket to an implementer [subagent](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/subagent) working in its own git worktree, merges each finished branch into a single **integration branch**, runs [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review) over the result, and resolves the tickets.

It reads the tickets as a **task graph**, not a list. Blocking edges decide what can start, so at any moment there is a **frontier** of tickets whose blockers have all landed, and every ticket on the frontier runs at once. That is the difference from working the tickets one by one. The graph's shape sets the pace, not the tickets' order on the tracker.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/implement-spec`, and the agent won't reach for it on its own.

In this OpenCode V2 fork, type `@implement-spec` in the primary session. It uses `general` child sessions for workers that write files, including shared exploration notes. Every worker receives an explicit worktree path; launching a child does not create worktree isolation. Built-in `general` children cannot launch nested subagents, so further delegation stays with the primary session. Background completion is notification-driven.

| Your situation | Reach for |
| --- | --- |
| A spec, split into tickets with blocking edges, that you want landed in one run | `/implement-spec` |
| One ticket at a time, in your own [context window](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/context-window), [clearing](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/clearing) between tickets | [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement) |
| A spec that isn't split into tickets yet | [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) first |
| A small piece of work with no real graph to it | [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement) directly |

## Prerequisites

- **An issue tracker.** The skill reads the tickets from, and resolves them on, the tracker [setup-matt-pocock-skills](https://aihero.dev/skills-setup-matt-pocock-skills) configured. If none has been configured, it stops and tells you to run that first rather than guessing.
- **Tickets with blocking edges**, as [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets) writes them. Without edges the graph is flat and every ticket starts at once.
- **A write-capable primary session with background subagent access.** The orchestrator creates and assigns worktrees explicitly; OpenCode does not isolate workers merely because they are child sessions.

## The integration branch

Everything lands on one branch. Each implementer:

1. confirms its fresh worktree's directory, branch, base and clean status before it starts,
2. builds its ticket with [tdd](https://aihero.dev/skills-tdd), red-green one slice at a time,
3. commits its ticket and returns the SHA, test evidence, skipped checks and blockers. A serial merge queue integrates completed tickets and checks the combined result.

The tracker decides whether a pull request exists at all. If your tracker closes work through PRs, or you ask for one, the skill opens a draft PR after the first merge and marks it ready at the end. Otherwise the run stops on the integration branch with every ticket resolved the way your tracker closes work, which works fully offline against a local markdown tracker.

Implementers talk to the orchestrator through [context pointers](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/context-pointer) (the spec, the ticket, shared exploration notes, earlier commits) rather than pasted summaries. This keeps each subagent's prompt small and leaves room in the orchestrator's window for the graph.

## Common questions

**How is this different from running `/implement` on each ticket myself?**

This is the question the skill exists to answer. Before it shipped, people kept building their own versions, and one user described the need: they wanted "subagents implement the tickets" instead of having "to individually create new session and tell them to implement a ticket one by one, when a spec may contain over 5 tickets." With `implement` you are the dispatcher: one [session](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/session) per ticket, clearing in between, and keeping track yourself of which tickets are unblocked. `implement-spec` hands that job to one orchestrating session. The price is that you no longer read each ticket's work as it lands; you review the integration branch at the end. To start a run, clear the context and type `/implement-spec` with a pointer to the spec (an issue number or a file path). For a small change with no real graph, skip it and use `implement` directly.

**Does it need GitHub? I want it to stop at the branch.**

No, not any more. One user who liked the in-progress version had exactly this complaint: "it creates a PR at the end, which requires an online repository like GitHub. I wish it could do the same work offline and stop at the branch where all the work is merged." The run now ends on the integration branch. A PR opens only when the configured tracker closes work through PRs or you ask for one, so on a local markdown tracker the run ends with every ticket resolved and the work merged on the branch.

**Its review and fix loop ran for hours, or kept "fixing" tickets that hadn't been built yet.**

The whole-spec review runs after every ticket has landed. Confirmed findings go to a fresh implementer and return through the merge queue. Focused checks verify those fixes; broader review repeats only for new changes or unresolved concerns.

**Does it drive tdd like implement does?**

Yes. The primary session confirms testing seams unless the spec already records approval, then passes that approval and acceptance criteria to each worker. Workers use `tdd` without asking you to approve the same seam again. A newly required seam returns to the parent for a decision.

**Two implementers running in parallel collided on the same file, or picked different names for the same thing.**

Worktrees don't remove collisions; they postpone them to merge time. A blocking edge written from ticket text is a guess about which files each ticket will touch, and two tickets on "different parts of the codebase" still share a message catalogue, a config registry, or a type. Each implementer sees only its own ticket and the shared notes, never the other's work in progress, so one user's web and mobile tickets added the same string as `blockedSince` and `blockedOn`. When two frontier tickets touch one shared file, either add a blocking edge between them so they run one after the other, or have the exploration notes fix the exact names each ticket adds.

**Blocked tickets never start, even after their blocker has merged.**

The orchestrator computes the frontier from tickets successfully merged and verified on the integration branch. Tracker closure may wait for the final PR merge, so it is not the readiness signal during implementation.

**Does this replace Sandcastle or an AFK script?**

No. People ask because the skills now reach into implementation: "is Sandcastle still relevant? Your skills now seem to be able to handle implementation as well." `implement-spec` puts an agent in charge of orchestration inside one harness session, which needs no infrastructure and lets you watch and steer. For work that is truly [AFK](https://www.aihero.dev/ai-coding-dictionary/afk), a deterministic loop ([Sandcastle](https://github.com/mattpocock/sandcastle), a shell script, a CI job) is faster, cheaper, and more reliable, because no agent makes the orchestration decisions.

**A ticket's key test was skipped inside its worktree, and it reported green.**

A worktree holds only tracked files. Missing local fixtures, databases, or credentials must be reported as verification blockers, not green checks. Arrange the required environment for the worker or integration checks before treating the ticket as verified.

## It's working if

- Several implementers are running at once whenever the graph allows, not one after another.
- A ticket starts as soon as its last blocker lands on the integration branch, not when the whole run ends.
- Every ticket's trace shows `tdd` running, with a failing test before the code.
- Implementation runs in parallel, while merges and integration checks run one at a time.
- Unexpected dirty worktrees are retained and reported; cleanup removes only clean, integrated worktrees owned by the run.
- The run ends on one branch with every ticket resolved, and a PR only if your tracker wanted one.

## Where it fits

`implement-spec` is the build step of the main chain, as the parallel alternative to running [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement) once per ticket:

```txt
grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement-spec → retro
```

Its neighbours are [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), which declares the blocking edges it reads as a task graph, and [code-review](https://aihero.dev/skills-code-review), which it runs over the integration branch before closing out. [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) is the router over the whole set when you are not sure which flow you are in.
